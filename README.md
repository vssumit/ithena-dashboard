The application renders by default to the dashboard page where you can change the date from the date-range picker to check the data changes.
All the changes are mocked with data for demo purposes.
Please note that the application will have to make API calls to servers where the data is returned from services.

The libraries used for the demo application are Chart.js & Angular Material.
